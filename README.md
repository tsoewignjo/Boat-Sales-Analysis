## Objective
To build an interactive dashboard visually showcasing well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

## Context
You are working as a data analyst for a yacht and boat sales website. The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends.

## Key Questions
1. Which regions get most of user views?
2. Is there a particular relationship between boat price and views?
3. Are there common features among the most viewed boats?

1. Original data:  10 columns, 9888 rows
2. After data cleaning: 8 columns, 9233 rows
3. Prepared for clustering: 6 columns, 9233 rows

## Analysis Criteria
You’ll conduct the following analyses:
● Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots, and categorical plots);
● Geospatial analysis using a shapefile;
● Regression analysis;
● Cluster analysis;
● Time-series analysis;
● Analysis narrative and final results (presented in your dashboard).
